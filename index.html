			<div></div>
			<img src="./assets/images/Steven_Fox_About_Me_Picture.jpg">
			<p>I live in Emeryville, CA and moved up the Bay Area back in July of 2015. I currently work at Art.com as an E-Commerce Manager and work as a barback at a bar called Prizefighter. I enjoy running, creative cocktails and craft beer, coding, being with friends and family.</p>
			<p>I am taking this course to broaden my knowledge in programming. Also, it will be beneficial to be able to take the applications that I have built and make them more interactive and user friendly through javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
